# Update Code-Spec - Capture Executable Contracts

When you learn something valuable (from debugging, implementing, or discussion), use this to update the relevant code-spec documents.

**Timing**: After completing a task, fixing a bug, or discovering a new pattern

---

## Code-Spec First Rule (CRITICAL)

In this project, "spec" for implementation work means **code-spec**:
- Executable contracts (not principle-only text)
- Concrete signatures, payload fields, env keys, and boundary behavior
- Testable validation/error behavior

If the change touches infra or cross-layer contracts, code-spec depth is mandatory.

### Mandatory Triggers

Apply code-spec depth when the change includes any of:
- New/changed command or API signature
- Cross-layer request/response contract change
- Database schema/migration change
- Infra integration (storage, queue, cache, secrets, env wiring)

<!-- BEGIN skill-garden patch trellis-update-spec-examples-output v0.6 -->
### Mandatory Output (6 Sections)

For triggered tasks, include all sections below:
1. Scope / Trigger
2. Signatures (command/API/DB)
3. Contracts (request/response/env)
4. Validation & Error Matrix
5. Scenarios and Examples (normal/base cases and at least one incorrect use with its correction)
6. Tests Required (with assertion points)

## Autonomous Spec Evaluation

This section replaces the interactive “whether to update” decision. The Code-Spec First Rule remains authoritative when an update is necessary. Package/layer code-specs hold executable contracts; shared guides hold short thinking checklists and pointers, not duplicate contract details.

### Result Contract

Every invocation must evaluate the available evidence autonomously and return exactly one result:

```yaml
spec_update_result:
  status: no-op | written | needs-review
  reason: string
  evidence: [string]
  changed_files: [path]
  validation: [string]
```

- `no-op`: no reusable executable contract was learned, the existing specs already cover it, the change is only a one-off implementation/copy/formatting detail, or the user explicitly asked to skip spec updates in the current request.
- `written`: code or test evidence supports a new executable contract, one authoritative target spec is unambiguous, and the minimal write plus focused validation completed successfully.
- `needs-review`: the target spec, business semantics, conflict resolution, or a validation failure cannot be resolved uniquely from repository evidence.

Do not enter the upstream Interactive Mode and do not ask whether a spec should be updated. Only `needs-review` may stop the workflow, and it may ask only one question that is necessary to resolve the current ambiguity.

### Evidence Order

Reuse already-read, unchanged evidence in this order; read missing or changed material. Do not decide from the chat summary, task title, or intuition alone:

1. For task context, the current task's `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` and every file they reference.
2. For task context, the current task's `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md`.
3. For untracked context, `untracked_flow.py status --verbose` for work id, summary, and stage; obtain validation evidence from the current Check-All result and current change set rather than the cursor helper.
4. The final Check-All conclusion and its actual validation evidence.
5. The current subject's actual diff, source code, tests, and commit evidence.
6. Existing specs and their indexes returned by `spec_router.py`.

When there is no active task, use a valid current-session untracked state when present; otherwise require an explicit Update-Spec invocation or a passed Check-All continuation authorized by its owner, and use the current request, actual diff, source/tests, and existing specs. Do not invent task evidence.

### Minimal Write Boundary

Capture the current dirty baseline before writing. `written` requires all of the following:

- Every change made by this Update-Spec invocation is under `.trellis/spec/**`. Do not modify business code, tests, workflow, skills, task artifacts, or any other file.
- Modify the smallest required section in the fewest files. Do not opportunistically rewrite, expand, reorganize, or format unrelated content.
- Prefer an existing authoritative spec. Create a new file only when no suitable spec exists, and update the corresponding index in the same invocation.
- Do not write a generic principle merely to avoid `no-op`. New content must provide a concrete executable contract such as signatures, fields, boundaries, error matrices, examples, or test assertions, while following the Code-Spec First Rule.

After writing, reread the spec diff and reverse-check it against source code and tests. At minimum run:

```bash
git diff --check -- .trellis/spec
```

When applicable, also validate indexes/links, code signatures, or project-specific spec checks. Fix uniquely resolvable validation failures inside this skill and rerun validation. Return `needs-review` for failures that cannot be resolved uniquely. If this invocation creates changes outside `.trellis/spec/**`, return `needs-review` with `reason=boundary-violation`, stop immediately, and do not proceed to Push. A completed `written` result does not trigger another manual Check-All.

### Workflow Disposition

- Interactive: follow the continuation decision made by Check-All's `Interactive Post-Check Stop Gate`, including strict pass and accepted-risk pass. A passed check defaults to this skill in the same turn after the Check-All report or brief acceptance acknowledgment; an explicit check-only or stop-after-check request keeps the chain stopped. When the user later says “下一步”, “继续”, `next`, `continue`, or an equivalent continuation intent, resume the deliberately stopped chain. Reuse a currently valid `spec_update_result` instead of evaluating again.
- Interactive completion, including direct Git: when the gate permits continuation, a `no-op` or `written` result must load `trellis-push` in the same turn and present its single confirmation plan; if there are no deliverable changes, report that no commit is needed instead of manufacturing an empty commit. Only `no-op` or `written` may proceed to `trellis-push`; `needs-review` stops and must not generate a Push plan. Reuse valid acceptance evidence internally without repeating unchanged risks. Default continuation does not authorize Git writes; do not infer risk acceptance or Git write authorization from unrelated history, summaries, dirty state, or an auto-loop internal `commit-only`. Do not treat an agent-authored "no commit/push" restriction in task artifacts or ordinary implementation-plan approval as an explicit user stop instruction; stopping this handoff requires an explicit user instruction, and pending Git write authorization does not block presenting the Push plan.
- Validated auto-loop: for `no-op` or `written`, execute `record --action run_spec_update --result ok`; only after a successful record immediately run `next`. If record returns `status=retryable` with an artifact recovery diagnosis, follow `trellis-auto-loop` recovery instructions in the same turn, then resubmit the original truthful record; do not advance or request user continuation. For `needs-review`, execute `record --action run_spec_update --result blocked --failure-type spec-needs-review`; never disguise it as `no-op`.
- Untracked: keep the cursor at `spec` for `needs-review`. For `no-op` or `written`, run `untracked_flow.py advance --stage push`. Any later product edit returns the cursor to `implement`; the helper does not validate or preserve owner evidence.

Do not ask again or rerun when a currently valid `no-op` or `written` result already exists. Re-evaluate after the actual diff, Check-All conclusion, or the user's spec intent changes.

- [ ] Did Scenarios and Examples cover normal/base cases and incorrect use with its correction?
<!-- END skill-garden patch trellis-update-spec-examples-checklist v0.6 -->
- [ ] Did you include required tests with assertion points?
- [ ] Is it in the right code-spec file?
- [ ] Does it duplicate existing content?
- [ ] Would a new team member understand it?

## Relationship to Other Capabilities

```
Development Flow:
  Learn something → `update-spec` (Trellis capability) → Knowledge captured
       ↑                                  ↓
  `break-loop` (Trellis capability) ←──────────────────── Future sessions benefit
  (deep bug analysis)
```

- `break-loop` analyzes bugs deeply and often reveals spec updates needed.
- `update-spec` evaluates and writes durable project guidance.
- Check-All decides whether the current result may continue to Update-Spec and Push.
