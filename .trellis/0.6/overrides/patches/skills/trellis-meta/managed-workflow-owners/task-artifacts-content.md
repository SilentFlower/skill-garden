| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `task.json` | Authoritative task metadata and lifecycle state, including optional recovery progress. |
| `prd.md` | Requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Lightweight tasks may be PRD-only. |
| `design.md` | Technical design for complex tasks: boundaries, contracts, data flow, compatibility, tradeoffs. |
| `implement.md` | Execution plan for complex tasks: ordered checklist, validation commands, review gates, rollback points. |
| `brief.md` | Generated planning handoff from the latest planning artifacts. It is displayed for review before activation, but does not replace `prd.md`, `design.md`, or `implement.md`. |
| `implement.jsonl` | List of spec/research files the implement agent must read first. |
| `check.jsonl` | List of spec/research files the check agent must read first. |
| `research/` | Research artifacts. Complex findings should not live only in chat. |
