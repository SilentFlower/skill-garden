## `/trellis:continue` Route Table

`/trellis:continue` resumes a task by deciding which phase step to load next. The decision combines `task.json.status` with the presence of artifacts inside the task directory. The mapping is fixed in the command itself; forks that add custom statuses must extend both the workflow.md tag block and this table.

| `status` | Artifact state | Resume at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planning` | `prd.md` missing | Phase 1.1 (load `trellis-brainstorm`) |
| `planning` | lightweight task with `prd.md` complete | ask for start review, then run `task.py start` |
| `planning` | complex task missing `design.md` or `implement.md` | complete missing planning artifacts |
| `planning` | complex task has `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` | ask for start review, then run `task.py start` |
| `in_progress` | no implementation in conversation history | Phase 2.1 (`trellis-implement`) |
| `in_progress` | implementation done, no `trellis-check` run | Phase 2.2 (`trellis-check`) |
| `in_progress` | check passed | Phase 3.3 (spec update) → 3.4 (commit) |
| `completed` | task is still in active tree | Phase 3.5 (run `/trellis:finish-work` to archive) |

When you add a custom status (e.g. `in-review`), add a `[workflow-state:in-review]` block in `.trellis/workflow.md` for the per-turn breadcrumb AND extend this route table — usually by editing the `/trellis:continue` command file (`.{platform}/commands/trellis/continue.md` or equivalent) to add a row that decides where to resume from. Without the route entry, `/trellis:continue` will fall through to a default branch and the user will not land on the step you intended.
