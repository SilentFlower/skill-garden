| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `task.json` | Task metadata: status, assignee, priority, branch, parent/child tasks, and similar fields. |
| `prd.md` | Requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Lightweight tasks may be PRD-only. |
| `design.md` | Technical design for complex tasks: boundaries, contracts, data flow, compatibility, tradeoffs. |
| `implement.md` | Execution plan for complex tasks: ordered checklist, validation commands, review gates, rollback points. |
| `implement.jsonl` | List of spec/research files the implement agent must read first. |
| `check.jsonl` | List of spec/research files the check agent must read first. |
| `research/` | Research artifacts. Complex findings should not live only in chat. |
