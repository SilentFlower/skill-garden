## Meaning Of Template Hashes

`.trellis/.template-hashes.json` records the content hash from the last time Trellis wrote a template file. `trellis update` uses it to distinguish three cases:

| Case | Update behavior |
| --- | --- |
| File was not modified by the user | It can be updated automatically. |
| File was modified by the user | Prompt the user to overwrite, keep, or generate `.new`. |
| File is no longer a current template | It may be deleted, renamed, or preserved according to migration rules. |

When an AI customizes local Trellis files, it does not need to maintain hashes manually. It is normal for Trellis update to recognize the result as "modified by the user."
