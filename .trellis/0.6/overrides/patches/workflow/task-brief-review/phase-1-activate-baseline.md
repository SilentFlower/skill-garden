#### 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]`

After artifact review, flip the task status to `in_progress`:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <task-dir>
```

For lightweight tasks, `prd.md` can be enough. For complex tasks, `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` must exist and be reviewed before start. On sub-agent-dispatch platforms, `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must both have real curated entries before start. Runtime consumers tolerate missing or seed-only manifests for compatibility, but that tolerance is not a planning-ready state.

After this command succeeds, the breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:in_progress]`, and the rest of Phase 2 / 3 follows.

If `task.py start` errors with a session-identity message (no context key from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or platform-native session env), follow the hint in the error to set up session identity, then retry.
