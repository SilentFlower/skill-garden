  WORKFLOW-STATE BREADCRUMB CONTRACT (read this before editing the tag blocks below)

  The [workflow-state:STATUS] blocks embedded in the ## Phase Index section
  below are the SINGLE source of truth for the per-turn `<workflow-state>`
  breadcrumb that every supported AI platform's UserPromptSubmit hook
  reads. inject-workflow-state.py (Python platforms) and
  inject-workflow-state.js (OpenCode plugin) only parse them — there is no
  fallback dict baked into the scripts after v0.5.0-rc.0.

  STATUS charset: [A-Za-z0-9_-]+. When the hook can't find a tag, it
  degrades to a generic "Refer to workflow.md for current step." line —
  intentionally visible so users notice and fix a broken workflow.md.

  INVARIANT (test/regression.test.ts):
    Every workflow-walkthrough step marked `[required · once]` must have a
    matching enforcement line in its phase's [workflow-state:*] block. The
    breadcrumb is the only per-turn channel; if a mandatory step isn't
    mentioned there, the AI silently skips it (Phase 1 planning gate
    skip and Phase 3.4 commit skip both manifested via this gap).

  TAG ↔ PHASE scoping:
    [workflow-state:no_task]      → no active task; before Phase 1
    [workflow-state:planning]     → all of Phase 1 (status='planning')
    [workflow-state:planning-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 1
    [workflow-state:in_progress]  → Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4
                                    (status stays 'in_progress' from
                                    task.py start until task.py archive)
    [workflow-state:in_progress-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 2/3
    [workflow-state:completed]    → currently DEAD: cmd_archive flips
                                    status and moves the dir in the same
                                    call, so the resolver loses the
                                    pointer (block kept for a future
                                    explicit in_progress→completed
                                    transition)

  Editing checklist:
    - When you change a [workflow-state:STATUS] block, also check the
      matching phase's `[required · once]` walkthrough steps for sync
    - Run `trellis update` after editing to push the new bodies to
      downstream user projects (block-level managed replacement)
