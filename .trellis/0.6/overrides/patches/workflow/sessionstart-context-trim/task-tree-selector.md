### Parent / Child Task Trees

Use a parent task when one user request contains several independently verifiable deliverables. The parent task owns the source requirement set, the task map, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review; it normally should not be the implementation target unless it also has direct work.

Use child tasks for deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently. Parent/child structure is not a dependency system: if one child must wait for another, write that ordering in the child `prd.md` / `implement.md` and keep each child's acceptance criteria testable.

Create new children with `task.py create "<title>" --slug <name> --parent <parent-dir>`. Link existing tasks with `task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>`, and unlink mistakes with `task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>`.
